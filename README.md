**feature.scala** is a collection of utilities to access Scala language features on the type level.

These utilities are used in [DeepLearning.scala](https://github.com/ThoughtWorksInc/DeepLearning.scala/) 2.0 to build its plugin system.

See [Scaladoc](https://javadoc.io/doc/com.thoughtworks.feature/factory_2.11) for a complete list of these utilities.
