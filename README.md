**feature.scala** is a collection of utilities to access Scala language features on the type level.

* [Caller](https://javadoc.io/page/com.thoughtworks.feature/caller_2.12/latest/com/thoughtworks/feature/Caller.html) - an implicit value that points to the function caller
* [Constructor](https://javadoc.io/page/com.thoughtworks.feature/constructor_2.12/latest/com/thoughtworks/feature/Constructor.html) - a dynamically generated type class for creating classes and traits from constructors.
* [Factory](https://javadoc.io/page/com.thoughtworks.feature/factory_2.12/latest/com/thoughtworks/feature/Factory.html) - a dynamically generated type class for creating classes and traits by automatically overriding abstract members.
